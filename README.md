## About me

Hi, I'm Duyen. After earning my degree in Commercial Business Management from the National Economics University, I worked as a Purchasing Staff and Sales Administration. During this period, I managed diverse tasks involving data synthesis and report creation. To enhance efficiency, I conducted research and acquired knowledge about data analysis tools, sparking my passion for data and data visualization.

Now, I'm eager to learn, work, and pursue a career in data analysis. My background in Business Management, along with my experience in purchasing and sales administration, offers a unique perspective for understanding business data. I'm enthusiastic about embracing new learning opportunities and contributing my skills to the field of data analysis.

In this portfolio, I have included some projects that showcase my data analytics abilities. I hope you find my portfolio informative and engaging, and I'm open to discussing my qualifications in more detail with you.

Thank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.
